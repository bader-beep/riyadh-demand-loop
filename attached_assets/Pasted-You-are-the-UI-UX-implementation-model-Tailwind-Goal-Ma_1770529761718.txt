You are the UI/UX implementation model (Tailwind).

Goal: Make the app feel premium and Apple-Maps-like with a list-first home (Trending) experience.
Constraints:
- UI-only changes (no backend/APIs/DB changes)
- Keep light+dark theme and Arabic-first RTL support
- Maintain clarity and restraint (avoid clutter)

TARGET UX (List-first)
Home/Trending page should have:
1) Top header area (clean, minimal):
   - Page title: “Trending now”
   - Subtext: “Based on recent activity”
   - Right side: theme toggle + language toggle (if exists)
2) Category selector (segmented control):
   - All | Cafés | Restaurants
   - Animated indicator (150ms ease-out)
3) Small filter row:
   - “Filters” button opens a sheet/panel (do not show all filters inline)
   - Optional “Compact / Comfortable” density toggle
4) Featured row:
   - Top 3 trending items as “Featured” (bigger cards) in a horizontal carousel on mobile, 3-up row on desktop
5) Main list/grid:
   - Show next 12–18 items by default
   - Mobile: 1 column list
   - Desktop: 2 columns grid
   - Add “View more” / pagination control (UI-only) to increase limit and load more

CARD DESIGN (Premium / Apple-like)
Each card must follow consistent anatomy:
- Row 1: name (clamp to 2 lines) + category pill
- Row 2: district (muted)
- Row 3: crowd badge + wait band pill
- Row 4: confidence micro text + last updated
- Row 5: Best time badge (highlighted)
- Row 6: family chips (icons)

Visual rules:
- Background surface + subtle border + soft shadow (no heavy shadows)
- Hover: slightly more shadow + border tint
- Radii: primary cards rounded-2xl; pills rounded-full; inputs/buttons rounded-xl
- Spacing: p-4 sm:p-5; gaps consistent (gap-2/3)
- Add skeleton loading states for cards (for fetch states)
- Empty states: “No results” + actions: Clear filters / Relax filters

FILTER SHEET (Selection categories box)
When user taps Filters:
- Open a right-side panel on desktop, bottom sheet on mobile
- Include:
  - Kids / Stroller / Prayer chips
  - Parking ease segmented: Easy | Med | Hard
  - Open now toggle
- Keep panel clean with section titles and dividers

MAP ENTRY (Secondary)
- Add a “Map” button near filters that opens /map (no need to embed map on home)

DELIVERABLES
- Updated Trending page layout
- New segmented control component (reusable)
- Updated card component with skeleton states
- Filter sheet component with chips + segmented parking
- List all files changed and brief notes

Do NOT add new features beyond layout/styling controls.
Do NOT change API payload shapes or backend logic.
